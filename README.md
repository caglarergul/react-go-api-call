# React & GoLang Rest Api Project

This project will help you to understand Rest Api call with ReactJS. 

I used a sample Rest Api which is codded in GoLang by <https://github.com/denizgokce>

## What I used.

* ReactJS, React DOM, React Router Libraries.
* Bootstrap 4
* HTML5 & CSS3
* Some old-school JavaScripts.
* Axios Rest Api Library <https://github.com/axios/axios>


## How can I run it?

Firstly clone this repo: https://github.com/caglarergul/react-go-api-call.git

After the clonning process run <pre>npm install</pre> then <pre>npm start</pre>
commands then check the http://localhost:3000 URL.

Happy Hacking...
